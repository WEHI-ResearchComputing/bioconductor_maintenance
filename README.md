# Schex Bioconductor

Bioconductor is a software ecosystem of software tools, packages and resources tailored specifically for the analysis and interpretation of high-throughput biological data. It is a pivotal and highly influential tool used by researchers in the field of Bioinformatics and computational Biology.

Many researchers at WEHI contribute to Bioconductor. We would like to find out if we can streamline some of the processes around Bioconductor to reduce the maintenance burden, or perhaps share best practices that we found were useful. Things such as removing dependencies, Continuous integration etc.
